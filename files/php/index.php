                <h2>Personal Bio</h2>
                    <p>I am in search of a web development career after completing my SLCC Web Development Certification. I'm hoping to improve through practice, experience, and working with others. My previous life experiences have taught me critical thinking, perseverance, and creativity. These skills will be an excellent foundation to help me succeed in the field of web development. </p>
                    <p>I completed my major in Music despite deciding not to pursue a long-term career in Music. I felt it was more important for me to finish my degree before having kids so it would open doors for me in the future once I decided which direction to go.</p>
                    <p>My professional experience is a little mismatched because I have gaps from becoming a mother after graduating from my university. I am working towards a career I will love, and web development feels like an excellent mix of my strengths in creativity, organization, and continual learning. </p>
